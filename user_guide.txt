this project is based on sorting algorithem visualization in a less complicated way.the program consist of 2 files main.py and bubble_sort.py.
first one is a user friendly gui which is actually the main component of the program and the secind one is a python script that consist of 
the sorting algothem which are analyzed in the main.initially the program can visulize only 6 sorting technique namely bubble sort,merge sort
insertion sort,selection sort,radix sort and quick sort.but the project is scalable and it can be extended into any number of sorting algorithem
by integrating it in the bubble_sort.py script.the gui is developed by tkinter in python 3 version 64 bit.
